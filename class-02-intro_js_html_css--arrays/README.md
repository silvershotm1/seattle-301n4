# Today's Plan: Week 1, Tuesday Lecture

#### Quiz 1 will be published this afternoon.

- [Go over the assigned readings](#readings) *[75 minutes]*

- [Code demo](#code) *[90 minutes]*

- Announcements:
 - Quiz 1 will be published at the end of lab this afternoon, and it will be due by 11:59pm Wednesday. We will go over it on Thursday.
 - Note that there will be some quiz content from time to time that we may not have covered yet for instance something on the quiz published today that we do not cover until tomorrow.
 - Keep in mind that you have unlimited re-takes on the quizzes, and also that the quizzes are designed to be treated like they are open-book. It's more about what you can figure out than what you have memorized.
 - Also, note that the quizzes have two main purposes:
  1. To get you to re-engage with the content in a different way, reinforcing your knowledge.
  2. To help you prepare for the Code 301 entrance exam, which you will take at the end of Week 3. There is a minimum threshold you must pass on that exam (70%), and also, that exam factors into your grade in this class.
- There will be lots of book-based detail work today on JS and CSS. We're going forward with the expectation that you will need little to no instruction on HTML since it is so straightforward.
- **Be sure to raise questions** about any topics that you'd like clarity about. If it is a topic that we will cover in the future, I'll let you know and maybe give a quick answer for meow. On this day in particular, where we have so much to cover, it is important to avoid going down time-consuming rabbit-holes.
- The reasons for going over the JS and CSS chapters in so much detail this morning, even though they do overlap with the pre-work quite a bit:
  1. Not everyone got the same amount of benefit/knowledge from completing pre-work.
  2. There are gaps, and omissions, and depth of the subject matter that need to be addressed.
  3. We're focusing on translating into "how we use this" and getting practice in applying this material within our new working environment of Atom, Chrome, and the terminal.

**Time to pimp your prompt!!!***

We're going finish the first half by trying to get your prompts all pimped out this morning, and what we'll do is have each of you install the prompt configuration that I use, knowing that you can always go to [ezprompt.net](ezprompt.net) to create your own customized settings later if you want. I'm expecting this to go smoothly for about 60-70% of you, and not as much for the others. What I'd like to try to do is have those with issues to work with a TA during the break to try to get a quick remedy. It also might be something that requires a deeper look during lab today.

## Live code

In our code demo today we'll be doing the following:
- Initializing a GitHub repo and working with Git commands
- Reading through the lab assignment, translating it into a to-do list, and fulfilling some technical components such as:
  1. Creating a basic scaffold for a code project
  2. Utilize `if/else` statements to handle conditional logic
  3. Add in some basic input validation
  4. Utilize good Git processes including a-c-p cycles
