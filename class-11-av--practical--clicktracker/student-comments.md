# Student Comments from Week 2

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- This week hammers you with a multitude of problems that are complex for a beginner. From events, event handling, to objects, constructor functions and prototypes.

*Sam says: No doubt, Week 2 is a huge flood of content. Once we get through the fundamentals in Week 1 and set the stage, off we go from basically solidifying the prework/tutorials to some fairly sophisticated and grown-up JavaScript topics in a big project... not to mention the bits on domain modeling and CSS layout. If you can handle Week 2, you're ready to handle pretty much anything, and I thought the class did a great job overall. The signature personality trait of your student cohort is work ethic.*

- The one on one time that I get to have with Sam and the TAs is beyond helpful. Having had little to no experience with coding before starting this class, naturally some of these concepts can be a little tough to grasp on the first try. I feel lucky to have Sam and his TAs who are always more than willing to help me figure something out, even if it takes a little longer than the rest of the class.

- The TAs are all so awesome. I find myself learning so much from just talking to them during labs. Nadia is amazingly patient when helping folks with problems. Pair programming works very well to learn about how to use git with small teams. I felt that the labs were also helpful in reinforcing material we read in the book or material covered in class.

- sWorking with my classmates and TAs. Asking questions about stuff I didn't know.

- TA Support has been excellent. They are really committed to helping the process of discovery without just giving you direct solutions.

*Sam says: We're here to help, and it's good to know that we've been serving you well so far.*

- i really like the code review part. It can show me different ways and better logic to approach solving the projects.

- The refactoring code review was quite helpful in teaching how to revise working code and improve upon it.

- Code review and a step by step discussion of the material. Also the teaching staff is extremely helpful and patient. It made a heavy work week tolerable.

*Sam says: You'll observe that as the class goes on, and in the ones that follow, code review takes on a bigger and bigger role. It's hugely important to how we learn code. While we were in Week 1, everyone's code was mostly the same. In Week 2, not nearly so much, and we are deliberate to give you just enough information to get going, but then to leave room for individual solutions to evolve. And then to look over those solutions. There will be a lot more of that this week.*

- Paired programming on the last day for the Layout project was probably the most I've progressed in CSS so far. Being able to collaborate and watch somebody who had a clearer understanding of CSS really helped.

- Sam has been very good at making course-corrections based on the input of the class. For instance reviewing GitFlow was very helpful and solidified a lot of the concepts we've been working with.

*Sam says: These comments belong together, though they do not appear to on the surface. You've learned more CSS than you realize up to this point. There's a few things we're doing differently this month to teach CSS more effectively, and though you may not sense it yet, it is working very well. The 'course-correction' we'll make this week is to solidify your CSS knowledge in a way that you know it is there.*

- Having access to the video of the class was extremely helpful.

- Having access to class videos now has been very helpful.

*Sam says: Thanks for your patience with the videos. It was a perfect storm of circumstances that got us out of whack on that part of things, but we're good on it now.*

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- The lack of CSS we've done so far, it was difficult to face such a large jump from hardly using CSS at all in the class to having the layout lab assignment.

- CSS. I would like a best practice work flow for how to approach CSS. For instance, having now tinkered with it, I realize it may be best to start with my major containing elements, fill them with color, place them, and then start tuning their MBP declarations in CSS. At which I starting adding piece by piece just making sure all my position is good before I start worrying about the content. I would call this "best practice" and I would have liked for that to have been taught to me, rather than having to have been frustrated with that at the end of a JavaScript intensive week.

*Sam says: In general, the workflow described here is a very solid approach. The point to keep in mind is that content can also affect layout, depending upon what kind it is and how much it is, such that a "containers-first" approach might not always work as smoothly as one would hope. That said, it is a solid approach. It is also worth noting that the process described here is very much the one that someone would take when they are utilizing a CSS framework. For this class, we're not going to allow CSS framework use, but when you get to 301, you can, with the caveat that you demonstrate understanding of every detail happening under the hood.*


- I like "pair programming", but I would suggest to have this done while everyone has almost same knowledge of coding and understand how to work on GH. And the team should understand the "15 mins rule". If you can't figure out more than 15-20 min, it's better to ask for help, instead of spending all the time to figure it out. Otherwise, we will spend a lot of time to work on the same project, and we still didn't get the result we want.

*Sam says: When there are pair-programming exercises, we take care to create pairs that are as complementary as possible. But it's not always perfect. The key is to continue to learn about yourself and the overall processes during those moments. A couple of weeks ago, pair-programming was not even on anyone's radar, most likely, and now after just a few times with it we're getting some very smart and nuanced observations like this one. Note that moving forward into 301, your lab assignments will be part solo, and part paired, every day.*

- We attempted to do the Layout project simultaneously, working from separate sides of the project. That created a couple issues - merge conflicts, different work progress, separated ideas.

*Sam says: Again, lessons learned from the struggles. More and/or better planning probably would have helped your team, and I recognize you're learning that part as we go along, too. We're learning a whole heck of a lot more than code.*

- I can't say anything was really "least" helpful. Maybe the timing of the daily lesson plans could be stricter? I usually am in dire need of a break by 10:45am at the latest and sometimes that first part of class goes on longer than that. Most of the time that's not a big deal since we are drilling down into important topics and at that point it would counterproductive to stop before a natural conclusion is reached.

*Sam says: Point taken, and I apologize for the discomfort caused! We'll be able to be a lot stricter on scheduling this week. The topics divide into smaller chunks more easily. This is an area of my teaching I am always working on improving.*

- Sometimes the more advanced students will steer the conversation into areas with more advanced concepts which can be confusing. I mentioned it to Sam and he has been good about answering questions and not getting too far off point.

- Deviation of content to explore tangent subjects. Though it is entertaining and we need a break every once in a while, I personally need all the the focus I can get on the study subject at hand.

- When dealing with more advanced concepts during our lectures even when the code is reviewed three or four times I sometimes still don't get it until I actually just open my console and start playing around. Usually by this point however the lecture goes elsewhere. So, it's kind of disorienting and sometimes I miss things.

*Sam says: Agreed, that this is important to manage. The advanced and unplanned topics are, in general, useful when managed as a "Here's a peek at the future..." kind of moment. Pacing on multiple timelines is tricky: what we need to know for this day or this week, versus that which is from the future but provides useful perspective if not immediate utility. The same goes for moments of discontinuity and levity: they're useful when managed properly. This kind of feedback helps me to dial in my "feel" on these things. As long as I've been doing this, I still learn new things every week.*

- The whole concept with the event handler information in regards to forms. Sometimes the information in examples are gone over lightly. I will find some sample code online as a guideline, but sometimes I still have problems translating it with the concepts of JS to my current code/project.

*Sam says: There's lots of event handler practice coming in this week's project. One point of warning regarding found sample code on events: there's a lot of ways to do things, and what we teach is the simplest and most straightforward way to get it done. Sure, it could be made a lot more complicated (sometimes needlessly so), but we strive to avoid that.*

- I struggled with the object constructor project and upon reflection I feel like if it had been been structured a little differently I would have been able to absorb the information in a much better fashion. If we'd been asked to create one working data table first and then create a second one using or altering what we had already built I think I'd have a much better grasp on the how and the why of all the working parts.

*Sam says: That's a great observation in that it is smart, when building things that will appear multiple times, to get one working and then adapt it for the others. This is a common coding process, often then culminating in a DRY approach that packages shared behavior into a function and then passing in the unique bits as arguments. There's multiple layers of constructing and editing that go into making good code. The core challenge of this week's project is a similar kind of problem where the smartest approach is to solve it once, in a simplified context, and then extend it to the rest of the design.*

- As I mentioned before, I feel like I'm getting a lot of help and guidance from Sam and the TAs and I'm grateful for that. I can't really say that I feel like they could do a better job.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- i don't mind to study in this temporary campus, but when it's not sunny outside, sometimes it's kinda dark in the lab area, especially in the mid of lab area.

*Sam says: I noticed that this week, too. I'll try to find a remedy.*

- Not that I can think of.

- Nope. Overall great experience so far. The stacked learning process is rather brilliant and seems to work exactly as described.

*Sam says: Glad it is working for you. I think a key part of making stacked learning work, and also to becoming a lifelong learner in general, is to understand how to accept the discomfort of not knowing something as well as you'd like. You have to have the confidence that you're going to get it, the tenacity to see it through, and ability to be balanced about the moment and not let it affect you emotionally and channel into destructive feelings such as frustration, slumped self-confidence, and eventually resignation.*

- No concerns at this time...

- None at this time.

- My concern is that things may go too quickly right now and not being prepared enough for upcoming project week.

*Sam says: Hang in there. This week is not as intense as Week 2, and Project Week is very much more free-form learning. But still transformational. You'll see.*
