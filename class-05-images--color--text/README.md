## Code demo for today's lab

Today's lab is a 'one-off' lab, in that it is not directly connected to your weekly project.

You'll be pair-programming again today, with a different partner than you had yesterday. The GitHub workflow today is different, too, and introduces the *upstream* concept. We need to spend a bit of time with it so that you understand what you are doing.

The concepts covered in todays lab (functions that receive input and return output) will be very helpful for you in next week's project.
