# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 14

Lab today will be a practice run in working with your project team. You're going to create a single project (in a new GitHub repo, natch, with all team members set up as Collaborators) with two HTML docs and supporting CSS and JS docs as needed.

One of the HTML docs is a design comp a la 'Chocoloate Pizza', based on the PREVIEW.tiff image in the adjoining assets directory.

**It is not expected that you will complete this project in any meaningful way. The point of the exercise is to get your feet wet in the group work process and to try some things for the first time without the pressure of working on your final project. Focus more on process than product, but still build the best thing you can. The more Git you do, the better.**

The other HTML doc will be a metric/standard conversion calculator. How you design it and implement it is up to you. Here are the technical requirements:
- Capable of doing the following conversions:
  - inches to/from centimeters
  - fluid ounces to/from milliliters
  - miles to/from kilometers
  - pounds to/from kilograms
  - standard shit-ton to metric shit-ton
- Receives user input via a single \<input> element, has a \<select> element to determine the conversion, and has a \<button> for users to click to perform the conversion
- The result is displayed in the browser window in this format: "1 inch equals 2.540 centimeters"
- Round decimals to the thousandths place as in example
- Maintain a list of all conversions performed on the window, and give user an option to clear the list
- Has a clear link to the other HTML document

Other than that, make that conversion page whatever you want.

There are no requirements about how each team member contributes, as there is on the final project, but each team member should keep a log of the parts that they work on, and in what role/capacity, for submission in Canvas at the end of the day.
