# Student Comments from Week 1

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Having access to an abundance of instructors to all bring their perspective onto any given question, and to have a professor who was willing to get multiple perspectives for each answer.

- Sam, Nadia, Dan and Spencer are responsive, kind, explain things very clearly and have infinite patience. Knowing that such a tremendous source of support is there does a lot to allow me to spend energy on really understanding what I'm learning and not just trying to get correct answers.

*Sam responds: Getting that understanding in place is the most important thing. That is the proper goal.*

- I appreciate that assignments are due in the morning before class begins. Having the option to wake up early to finish course work instead of staying up late is very helpful.

- Partner pairing for lab has probably been the most frustrating and helpful thing this week. It has forced us to become fairly comfortable with Github which is new for me and is very important.

*Sam responds: Typical to feel that way after a first experience in pair programing!*

- I can't really point to one specific thing. The times where we iterated the same process multiple times were the most helpful. If that didn't happen, things were harder.

- Pair programming was most helpful in fleshing out the ideas we learned in class.

- The part where I was getting my ass kicked with learning code on day two.

- class lecture and code review are helpful to explain the concept and code and also can help to clarify the confusion in reading and project assignment.

- It is all new to me so just being on site is helpful. The hands on, 1 0n 1 with Sam and his TA's is especially helpful. I love how they take the time to explain and walk me through things without spoon feeding me. I learn so much when struggling through a problem but have to remember to not get bogged down in the weeds and ask for help.

*Sam responds: Our aim when providing direct guidance to students is exactly as you describe: help the student to understand without spoonfeeding the solutions.*

- CSS and Git were the most useful because I did not work much with these

- Being in pairs in lab because it created an open discussion environment to solve problems. Repetition of problems over and over helped. Also typing out instead of copy/paste really was beneficial.

- Both the lecture and lab.

- Pair programming and practical demonstrations. Pair programming: For myself not having any foundation base in code, to be able to work and see how my partner goes through the mapping process gave me a keen insight as to the process in general. In effect, breaking larger problems down to a workable size instead of trying to code of the fly. Practical Demonstrations: This help visualize the actual code to end product process. In other words the code I input actually does stuff.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

*GITHUB*

- Working in the Terminal, Git and GitHub are the aspects of this course that are the least familiar to me and I've struggled with this. The way our lecture days are laid out the new concepts for Git and GitHub often come last, which means that the instruction for that is either abbreviated or sped up so we can get through all the material. Inevitably I stumble over this in Lab and all my bumbling usually means I end up having to unlearn some wrong moves and ultimately I'm left with a fuzzy understanding of the correct steps. I do wish there were a few more basic exercises where we could work all the way through creating a repo, forking, branching, merging, putting in pull requests and bringing everything back together to get the steps down.

- The gitHub stuff seems slightly ambiguous at times and you really need to know exactly what you are doing at any given moment to avoid conflicts and mistakes. I guess that's what all the practice is for.

- GITHUB training. GitHub is helpful, but the training on how to use GitHub has been confusing so far, especially on Friday's lab.

- The initial github setup wasn't a problem, but the more advanced commands with pushing to branches instead of masters is still somewhat unclear.

*Sam responds: In retrospect, I definitely could have done a better job with instructing GitHub. We'll be a lot more deliberate with that and provide more precise guidance and materials on how to do things. There is a certain amount of pain in learning Git that only comes from experience; however, there's been a little too much of that.*

*READING*

- I understand why it was done but the extensive reading review this week was least helpful for me because I did the readings and already had a solid grasp on the material.

- A lot of the reading is hard for me to conceptualize raw. I have to basically have a console open to mess around with as I do the reading.

*Sam responds: Readings are a necessary evil, in that they provide a consistent baseline foundation of knowledge for the course. Furthermore, a big part of the profession is the ability to use new code tools and techniques strictly from self-teaching via documentation... in other words, learning by reading. At the same time, the benefit each student derives from reading varies widely. As time goes by I have de-emphasized the reading more and more and more over the past year, now basically instructing students to just skim the reading for what they think they need. I don't know now much more it can be dialed back beyond that. Other than creating custom documentation for each class, which is highly impractical, I can't think of an alternate solution.*

*SCHEDULE*

- I think having the labs in the afternoon is hard for me. I am my best in the morning and by the afternoon I feel fairly brain dead. But, I suppose that's the price you pay for a bootcamp style schedule.

*Sam responds: I've taught this class a few times with the schedule inverted, with afternoon lectures and morning labs, and was not as effective overall. There's always going to be variance among individuals, though.*

*PACING*

- Javascript - personally, the pace is slower for me because I already have some experience programming in other languages.

- For me, understanding the process is key. And what I mean by that is a deliberate understanding of what does what and where and this makes this do that, sort of thing. Explaining the principles and the rule of thumb aspect so I can construct the process. I understand the stack module teaching method is fast moving and 'stacks' new points to where you are constantly catching up. I have to make peace with that process but in the mean-time I beginning to feel lost. I know this will take time so I look forward to get further clarity next week.

*Sam responds: Some number of students say pacing is too slow, and others say it is too fast. It's like that every month. Dialing in the exact right pace every day is kind of like surfing, in that there's a lot to balance that is unpredictable, and you just have to ride it the best you can.*

- I can't think of an instance where I did not get a satisfactory answer or explanation to an issue I was having. So far all the tools and help I've needed have been provided.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

*FACILITIES*

- I would like to not have to change seats halfway through the day for lab. I would also like to be able to get to the class via a door closer than the main door.

- I am minorly concerned about the facility, but I know that much of that is out of the hands of CF. I'm just not a huge fan of getting carpet glue all over my bag, shoes and laptop cables. Other than that one quibble, you guys are doing great. Very excited to dig in and expand my horizons.

*Sam responds: Our space is imperfect, to say the least, and thankfully only temporary. Unfortunately, it's also what we have right now.*

- I would suggest to divide the lab time into two part. One is for working on your project assignment in a quiet environment. Another one is open for discussion lab- people can discuss their issue with TA if they have problem with coding. It might help to work on project effectively without affecting others while coding.

*Sam responds: If it is not a pair-programming lab assignment, students are free to wander to try to find a quieter space to work. Doing so compromises your immediate access to the instructors and TAs, who will be in the usual group workspace, but that is your choice. The typical solution for sonic isolation in noisy group work spaces is headphones. This co-working environment is not at all uncommon in tech these days.*

- This is a really fast-paced and intensive course, especially if you've been out of school for a while. It would be nice if some of the alumni would show up (either in person or on some social platform) and share their experiences out in the world. First person accounts of what it's really like out there for a code school grad in a world that seems dominated by a CS degree-hungry market would be extremely informative.

*Sam responds: Those kinds of meetings with alums happen in the 401 courses, and there's always Slack as a way to get this kind of interaction with alums.*

- Is there any resource like TA's at code fellows that are around on 'off' days(Saturday or Sunday) that I could talk to if I needed some extra explanation on things? Not sure if that was possible or something like that would need to go through the instructor.

*Sam responds: I strive to maintain accessibility on Slack throughout the weekend. Looking back, this past weekend I responded to student inquiries on Saturday afternoon at 3:00pm and 5:00pm, and on Sunday around noon, 1:30pm, 4:00pm, 9:00pm, and 10:30pm.*

- A lot of materials on the first week of class a little bit scary.

- My only concern is about my own learning process and if stack module is right for me. Should l be not worried because there is an expected curve of understanding? Am I in the typical spot at this point of the course?

*Sam responds: The first couple of days of this week will tell a lot, in that you've had a weekend to rest, reflect, and recover. We'll have a lot better feel for where everyone is by Wednesday.*
