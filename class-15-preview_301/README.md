# Today's Plan: Week 3, Friday Lecture... LAST CLASS DAY!

#### We will start today by reviewing Quiz 7.

#### Reminder: Quiz 8 (only 5 questions!) is due tonight.

#### The Code 301 entrance exam will be published today. We are testing out a new integration with Canvas this time around, such that the EdRepublic-served exam will be integrated right into Canvas. If you've seen some false alarms on the exam assignment being published, that's why, because there was some trial-and-error in getting it set up.

- Announcements
  - Reminder: weekly surveys will go out to students today
  - We're in Project Week! Keep in mind that Monday is a holiday, so we will not be here and CF will (probably) not be open, but you and your team are free to set up any work processes that day that you choose to.
  - Remember that each team will be expected to do a 5-10 minute standup meeting at the beginning of each day. Those will begin on Tuesday morning. No set time, just when your team is assembled and the instructional staff are free.
