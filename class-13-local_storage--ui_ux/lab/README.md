# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 13

Be sure to go back and re-read [the original problem domain from Class 11](../../../class-11-av--practical--clicktracker/README.md). Today we'll be focusing on implementing all of the little pieces that have not been finished so far.

### New Bus Mall Technical Goal

- Give your BusMall app persistence by using local storage to store your voting data! The goal is to have all of your data persist through a page refresh or through completely closing the browser.

### Reminder list of things to implement

- "The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown. So, you'll also need to keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the associated calculations."

- Stretch goal (not required, but work on it if you'd like an additional challenge): Prepare a report for the marketing team that gives them a table of data analysis on a separate HTML page, maybe something like this:

![table](table-sample.png)

- If you choose to build the table, you can do so however you want and also customize however you think is appropriate.

- You are also responsible for the look and feel of the app (the UI/UX, in other words), so don't forget a custom font, color palette, layout with semantic HTML, and so on.
