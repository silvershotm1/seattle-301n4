# Today's Plan: Week 3, Wednesday Lecture

#### Reminder: Quiz 7 will be published after class this morning and will be due at 11:59pm tomorrow night.

#### Quiz 8 will be published tomorrow afternoon, and will be due Friday night at 11:59pm.

#### You will receive a link in an email on Friday to take the entrance exam for Code 301, and it will be due by Monday (not sure if by morning or by end of the day). Please take this exam even if you are not planning to go to Code 301 right away, as it is part of your grade for this course. Also, note that the email you'll receive comes from EDRepublic and, depending on your spam filter settings, might get routed into a spam folder. I'll make an announcement in Slack once I know the link has been sent.

## UI & UX discussion

Let's do a discussion on UI/UX and take a look at some sample student projects from prior classes to evaluate their how they look, how they feel, and how easy they are to use. Let's also look at a few websites relating to design and interaction.
- [All Websites Look the Same](http://www.zeldman.com/2015/09/10/all-websites-look-the-same/)
- [5 Ridiculously Common Misconceptions about UX](https://www.sitepoint.com/5-ridiculously-common-misconceptions-about-ux/)

When you start with your own projects, one of the things you will be fully responsible for is UI and UX.

## Project Pitches

Let's hear the first round of project pitches! We'll keep track of them in this document.

- Uma: Memory game with cards: start w subset facedown, open a few random, give user a few secs to look, close, then user recalls which were shown where. Track user progress over iterations. Degrees of difficulty involving # of cards and time see cards

- John: SSI (Seattle Shadiness Index): muni data + crime data updated to the day and minute, map locations

- Megan: Advanced OrcaCard Users tips and info; Calculator for monthly vs. daily; users leave tips; mobile-friendly (location driven)

- George: Game: tern-based combat game; attack, defense, heal buttons, choose weapons/technique; increasing difficulty; visuals? canvas/CSS

- Michael: Pleasant urban hiking; grade, traffic, shortest; Data viz of City/maps stuff; Speed/ distance/ traffic; How would a user interact? Investigate more
